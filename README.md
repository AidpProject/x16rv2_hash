# x16rv2_hash

This is a repository for the X16Rv2 hashing algorithm that is used by Ravencoin beginning October 1st, 2019.

You can use this repo for python or nodejs, or simply refer to the C files to see how the algo is implemented.

For python, run ``python setup.py install`` (virtualenv with python 3.7 is my recommendation)

For nodejs, you should be able to do ``npm install https://github.com/traysi/x16rv2_hash/``
